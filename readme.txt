I preferably take support requests as [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/felixarntz/global-admin/issues), so I would appreciate if you created an issue for your request there. However, if you don't have an account there and do not want to sign up, you can of course use the [wordpress.org support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/global-admin) as well.
